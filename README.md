BrownSRIFwebsite
================

Winter Break Project 2012.  Project is to revamp the site brownsrif.org.

Using Django and twitter-bootstrap.  Hosted using a free Heroku account.


This project was to create a website for Brown Socially Responsible Investment fund, where
the club's administrators could easily update the website without much web knowledge through a /admin interface.
Visit the site at: www.brownsrif.org


My friend and peer at Brown, Gabriel (git account: fastturtle), helped me use Django and deploy to Heroku.
