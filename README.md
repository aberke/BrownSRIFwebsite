BrownSRIFwebsite
================

This project was to create a website for Brown Socially Responsible Investment fund, where
the club's administrators could easily update the website without much web knowledge.
Visit the site at: brownsrif.org


Gabriel (fastturtle) and I, gathered the static html files he had previously written.
We used Django to create a new website.
